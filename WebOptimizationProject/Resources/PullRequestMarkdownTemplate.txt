## Optimization

The Web Optimization Project optimized this repository. All optimizations (compressions) are done losslessly and no quality / data is lost. This is also verified afterwards by the Wop so you can be sure that your images are exactly the same.

Check the comments below to find out exactly what files where optimized :smile:
